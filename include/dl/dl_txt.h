	Function: dl_txt_pack
		Pack string of intermediate-data to binary blob that is loadable by dl_instance_load.

	Parameters:
		dl_ctx          - Context to use.
		txt_instance    - Zero-terminated string to pack to binary blob.
		out_buffer      - Buffer to pack data to.
		out_buffer_size - Size of out_buffer.
		produced_bytes  - Number of bytes that would have been written to out_buffer if it was large enough.

	Return:
		DL_ERROR_OK on success. Packing an instance to a 0-sized out_buffer is thought of as a success as
		it can be used to calculate the size of a packed instance.
		If out_buffer_size is > 0 but smaller than the required size to pack the instance, an error is
		returned.

	Note:
		The instance after pack will be in current platform endian.
